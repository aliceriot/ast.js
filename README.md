# ast.js

A site which will generate an AST from a JavaScript program and show
a nice d3 visualization of that tree. Check it out
[here](https://aliceriot.github.io/ast.js/)!

## Viewing locally

If you want to view this on your own machine, after cloning the repo do:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    npm install
    npm start

And that should work?
